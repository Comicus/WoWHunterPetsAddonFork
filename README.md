# WoWHunterPetsAddonFork
The Hunters Menagerie is an addon that assists in the tracking, taming and collecting of hunter pets. It provides ease of access to information that can help you along your journey to catch the coolest and most sought after pets, without needing to have a guide/resource like Wowhead or Petopia open at all times.

 

Features Included
* An added Hunter Pets tab to your collections tab

")
  *  The ability to search through in game hunter pets to see where they spawn (map included) and view their 3d model in game, as well as the ability to filter by desired traits such as whether or not they have an ability (for example Battle res or heroism)

Please note there are currently still errors that will occur, but I am working on resolving them and you should be able to close them and use the addon like normal.

To do list:

   1. Update the Pet families
   2. Make Stabled pets pane be a toggle so you don't have to see it on login. 
   3. Add the ability to close the window via the escape key.
   4. Work on profile functionality as non hunters generally arent going to need to see stabled pets. 
   5. Touch up the frames as the X button for the hunters collection has a weird hitbox and is not easily closed if you dont know where to look.
